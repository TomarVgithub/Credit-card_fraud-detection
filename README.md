Advances in communication technology and e-commerce have made the credit card a popular online payment method. Therefore, security in this system is highly expected to prevent fraud. Credit card transaction fraud 
transactions are increasing year by year. In this way, researchers also experiment with novels to detect and prevent such fraud. However, there is always a need for some strategy to master this trick. This paper proposes a 
system to detect fraud in credit card details using an unregulated neural learning process (NN). The proposed method exceeds the existing Auto Encoder (AE), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Isolate Forest (IF) and K-Means 
clustering methods. The proposed NN fraud detection method works with 99.87% accuracy and the existing AE, IF, LOF and K Means methods provide 97℅, 98℅, 98℅ and 99.75℅ accuracy.
